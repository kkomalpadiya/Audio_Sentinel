# Task progress

## Working arrangement

Continue both Person A and Person B tasks in this project while Person B is
unavailable. Keep task IDs so dependencies remain clear. Explain any manual steps
and add a short beginner-friendly explanation at the end of each completed task.

## A1.1 — Complete

Defined preprocessing settings and the prepared-audio manifest contract. Added
validation, JSON schemas, example JSON files, and the audio preparation guide.
The existing Phase 0 clip schema and preprocessing interface remain compatible.

Verification: all 69 tests pass (16 existing tests and 53 A1.1 cases), and the
project verification script passes. Updated tracker:
`outputs/a1_1_tracker_update/Audio_Sentinel_Master_Task_List.xlsx`.
It records 10 completed tasks out of 72 and assigns the 25 remaining Person B
tasks to Person A while preserving the original task IDs and completed ownership.

No manual setup, download, or audio processing is required for this task. Review
and commit this checkpoint before continuing if following the existing commit workflow.

Following task: B1.1 — Implement local audio loading and input validation.

## B1.1 — Complete

Implemented local WAV/FLAC loading with source metadata, original-file hashing,
permission checks, containment checks, input limits, and decoded-memory limits.
The loader returns float32 samples without changing sample rate, channels, or volume.
Added regression tests, a generated-tone smoke test, and `docs/audio-loading.md`.

Verification: all 118 tests pass with no skips. The project verification script and
the generated-tone smoke test pass. Tests include Windows junction containment,
truncated WAV/FLAC, invalid samples, and consent expiry before and after decoding.

Tracker at completion: `outputs/b1_1_tracker_update/Audio_Sentinel_Master_Task_List.xlsx`.
It records 11 completed tasks out of 72. No manual installation or download is
needed. Review and commit this checkpoint when ready.

Following task: A1.2 — Implement mono conversion, resampling, and loudness normalization.

The loader turns the audio file into a table of numbers, checks that the file and
permission are valid, and attaches a record of where those numbers came from.

## A1.2 — Complete

Implemented channel averaging, filtered resampling with the contracted frame count,
and RMS normalization with gain/peak limits. Added an in-memory helper connecting
these operations to loader output, normalization measurements, regression tests,
a synthetic smoke test, and `docs/audio-transforms.md`.

Verification: all 161 tests pass with no skips. The project verification script and
transform smoke test pass. Tests check pitch, anti-alias filtering, timing, stereo
balance, silence, gain/peak limits, memory limits, and original-data preservation.

Tracker at completion: `outputs/a1_2_tracker_update/Audio_Sentinel_Master_Task_List.xlsx`.
It records 12 completed tasks out of 72. No manual installation or download is
needed. Review and commit this checkpoint when ready.

Following task: B1.2 — Implement optional configurable noise reduction.

Mono conversion combines channels, resampling puts the recording on a common
timing grid, and normalization adjusts volume with limits. The result stays in
memory for the later noise-reduction, windowing, and persistence tasks.

## B1.2 — Complete

Implemented configurable stationary spectral gating with noise estimation from the
clip, smoothed attenuation, exact-length reconstruction, short/silent bypass,
diagnostics, and a spectral workspace budget. Integrated it after resampling and
before normalization. Disabled mode preserves A1.2 samples exactly. Updated schemas,
examples, regression tests, and the noise-reduction guide and synthetic smoke test.

Verification: all 199 tests pass with no skips. Project checks and the synthetic
smoke test pass. At strength 0.8, the fixed synthetic case improved SNR from 14.06
to 17.51 dB. Real-dataset effectiveness remains to be evaluated; default stays off.

Current tracker: `outputs/b1_2_tracker_update/Audio_Sentinel_Master_Task_List.xlsx`.
It records 13 completed tasks out of 72. No manual installation or download is
needed. Review and commit this checkpoint when ready.

Next: B1.3 — Implement deterministic overlapping window segmentation.

Noise reduction estimates recurring background frequencies, turns down weaker
components near that estimate, and reconstructs the original-length recording.
It is optional because useful sustained sounds can also resemble background noise.
